        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Dr. Shah Nawaz Khan, a dedicated medicinal chemist with a focus on synthetic organic chemistry. I obtained my Master of Philosophy from the University of Malakand and subsequently pursued my Ph.D. at Shanghai Jiao Tong University on a CSC Type A Scholarship. Under the supervision of Professor Zhankui Sun, I developed innovative synthetic methodologies, focusing on the photocatalytic decarboxylative C-O, C-C, and C-N functionalization of carboxylic acids. My work has been pivotal in advancing our understanding of photocatalytic processes, with significant applications in medicinal chemistry.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>My research journey began with my Master of Philosophy at the University of Malakand, where I worked on [specific project details]. I then moved to Shanghai Jiao Tong University for my Ph.D. studies, focusing on photocatalytic decarboxylative C-O, C-C, and C-N functionalization of carboxylic acids. Some of my notable research projects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photocatalytic Decarboxylative Hydroxylation:</strong> Developed a novel synthetic route for the hydroxylation of carboxylic acids, followed by the total synthesis of GR24 derivatization.</li>
            <li><strong>Anticancer Compound Analysis:</strong> Collaborated with a local hospital to analyze the anticancer activities of newly synthesized compounds, bridging the gap between synthetic chemistry and biomedical applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Mentoring and Supervision:</strong> Supervised several Ph.D. and master's students, guiding their research projects and synthesizing various starting materials and intermediates necessary for their work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In my postdoctoral research, I continued to explore the frontiers of medicinal chemistry, focusing on the design and synthesis of novel compounds for therapeutic applications.</p>
