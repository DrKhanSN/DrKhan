# DrKhan
I am Dr. Shah Nawaz Khan, a passionate and dedicated medicinal chemist with a robust background in synthetic organic chemistry. My academic journey began with a Master of Philosophy from the University of Malakand, where I developed a strong foundation in chemical research and methodology. I further honed my expertise during my Ph.D. at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the prestigious CSC Type A Scholarship. Under the mentorship of Professor Zhankui Sun, I specialized in the development of innovative synthetic methodologies, particularly focusing on the photocatalytic decarboxylative C-O, C-C, and C-N functionalization of carboxylic acids. This work has contributed significantly to the field of photocatalysis and its applications in medicinal chemistry.

Throughout my career, I have been driven by a commitment to advancing medicinal chemistry through rigorous research and collaboration. My research has spanned various groundbreaking projects, including the development of novel synthetic routes for the hydroxylation of carboxylic acids, the synthesis of anticancer compounds, and the total synthesis of GR24 derivatives. I have also played a pivotal role in mentoring the next generation of chemists, supervising Ph.D. and master's students, and contributing to the academic community through teaching and collaborative research.

I am proud to have authored and co-authored numerous publications in high-impact scientific journals, reflecting my contributions to the field and my ongoing dedication to scientific excellence. My work continues to bridge the gap between synthetic chemistry and practical biomedical applications, aiming to address some of the most pressing healthcare challenges through innovative chemical solutions
